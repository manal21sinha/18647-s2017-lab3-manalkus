/**
 *  A clock implementation that runs based on the ADC sample time.
 *  Each major tick is represented by the ADC DMA buffer being filled up.
 *  Minor ticks are counted in the sample number of each buffer.
 *
 *  This class is closely correlated to the ADCSampler. Be sure to understand
 *  how each component is tied together to keep sample timing in line.
